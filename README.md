CanaBot
=======

An integrated skype chatbot used for the tracking, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the growing process for cannabis (and all other) plants. The project was built over the course of 30 hours at a Toronto Hackathon, Hack The Valley 2.

We used Python to process the data and run it through a matching algorithm, and Node.js as the backend, using it to communicate with Microsoftâ€™s LUIS machine learning API to determine user input. The user interacts with the chatbot via the Skype Bot framework, and the demo was displayed on a website using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript through the Bootstrap library.

Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or other contact method with me before making a change. 

As is the case with most Hackathons, the code is not very readable as it was "hacked" together in only 30 hours.
